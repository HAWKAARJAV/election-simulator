# 🗳️ Election Synchronization Feasibility & Impact Simulator

**Live Demo:** https://electionsimulator.netlify.app/

> **A web-based simulation dashboard to evaluate the financial, administrative, and governance impact of synchronized elections using assumed data.**  
> *Context reference only: One Nation One Election*

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Election Synchronization Feasibility & Impact Simulator** is a decision-support web application designed to help users experiment with different election scheduling scenarios and objectively understand their potential impact on governance, administration, and public expenditure.

The platform is **strictly analytical and non-political**.  
It does **not advocate or oppose any policy**. Instead, it enables **data-driven comparison** through transparent assumptions and explainable simulation logic.

## ❓ Problem Statement

India conducts elections frequently across states and levels of government. While this strengthens democratic participation, it also introduces systemic challenges:

- 📉 Repeated enforcement of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), slowing governance and policy execution  
- 💰 High recurring administrative and security costs  
- 🧑‍💼 Continuous redeployment of election personnel and infrastructure  
- 🗳️ Voter fatigue caused by frequent polling cycles  

Despite ongoing discussions around election synchronization, there is **no simple, neutral, and data-driven tool** that allows stakeholders to objectively assess:

- Feasibility of synchronization  
- Administrative and governance trade-offs  
- Cost implications over time  

As a result, discussions often remain **opinion-driven rather than evidence-based**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This project introduces a **simulation-based web dashboard** that allows users to:

- Define election synchronization scenarios  
  *(Current system / Partial synchronization / Full synchronization)*  
- Compare these scenarios against the existing election cycle  
- Instantly visualize projected outcomes through metrics and charts  

All outputs are generated using **assumption-based dummy data**, clearly separated from simulation logic to ensure transparency and ethical use.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Provide a **neutral decision-support tool** for election scheduling analysis  
- Enable **scenario-based comparison** using explainable metrics  
- Translate complex governance trade-offs into **measurable indicators**  
- Support **data-driven discussion** in academic and policy settings
