# Election Synchronization Feasibility & Impact Simulator

Live demo: https://electionsimulator.netlify.app/

## Project overview

- A web-based simulation dashboard to analyze the potential impact of synchronized elections using assumed (dummy) data.
- Context reference only: One Nation One Election.
- Strictly analytical and non-political.

## Objective

- Provide a neutral, data-driven decision-support tool to simulate election scheduling scenarios and evaluate their potential financial, administrative, and governance impacts.

## Problem background

- Frequent elections across states and governance levels can cause:
  - Governance disruption (Model Code of Conduct periods)
  - Recurring administrative and security costs
  - Repeated deployment of officials and resources
  - Voter fatigue

## Proposed solution

- Interactive dashboard where users can:
  - Choose different election synchronization scenarios (Current / Partial / Full)
  - Compare scenarios against the current system
  - View projected outcomes via metrics and charts
- Uses assumption-based dummy data only; no voter or personal data.

## How the system works (high-level)

User inputs (scenario & assumptions) → Simulation engine (rule-based logic) → Impact metrics calculation → Dashboard with charts & indicators

## Key features

- Scenario simulation: Current vs Partial vs Full
- Impact visualization (charts & indicators)
- Estimated election costs
- MCC duration comparison
- Governance stability score
- Administrative load indicator
- Ethical & neutral design; no political messaging

## How to run locally (short)

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:8080
```

3. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Project layout (short)

- `src/` — frontend source (pages, components, hooks, libs)
- `public/` — static assets (logo, robots.txt)
- `package.json` — scripts and dependencies

## Notes & disclaimer

- Uses assumed data only; not connected to real election systems.
- Built for research, education, and demonstration purposes.

🗳️ Election Synchronization Feasibility & Impact Simulator

A web-based simulation dashboard that helps analyze the potential impact of synchronized elections using assumed data.
(Context reference only: One Nation One Election)

⸻

📌 Project Overview

The Election Synchronization Feasibility & Impact Simulator is a decision-support web application designed to help users experiment with different election scheduling scenarios and understand their possible impact on governance, administration, and cost.

The platform is strictly analytical and non-political.
It does not advocate any policy—it only enables data-driven comparison.

⸻

❓ Problem Background

India conducts elections frequently across states and governance levels. This often leads to:
  •	📉 Governance disruption due to repeated Model Code of Conduct (MCC)
  •	💰 High recurring administrative and security costs
  •	🧑‍💼 Repeated deployment of officials and resources
  •	🗳️ Voter fatigue caused by frequent elections

Despite ongoing discussions, there is no simple, neutral tool to objectively evaluate the feasibility and impact of synchronizing elections.

⸻

💡 Proposed Solution

This project provides a simulation-based dashboard where users can:
  •	Choose different election synchronization scenarios
  •	Compare them against the current election system
  •	Instantly view projected outcomes through metrics and charts

All results are generated using assumption-based dummy data, making the system transparent and safe for academic use.

# Election Simulator

## Project info

This repository contains the source for the Election Simulator application (Vite + React + TypeScript).

## How to run locally

Requirements: Node.js and npm (or pnpm).

```sh
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
npm install
# One Nation One Election — Election Synchronization Feasibility & Impact Simulator

**Domain:** One Nation One Election

## Project summary

This repository contains the Election Synchronization Feasibility & Impact Simulator — a data-driven web application that models the constitutional, administrative, financial, and governance impacts of implementing a One Nation One Election policy across national, state, and local bodies.

### Problem statement

How can a data-driven simulation tool be developed to analyze the constitutional, administrative, financial, and governance impact of implementing One Nation One Election across states and local bodies?

This project provides an interactive UI to configure assumptions, run simulations, and compare outcomes across scenarios (current system vs. partial synchronization vs. full synchronization).

## Features

- Configure simulation inputs: election scope, synchronization type, time horizon, cost assumptions, MCC duration, participating states.
- Run deterministic simulations and view summarized results (cost, MCC days, governance score, administrative load).
- Side-by-side comparisons and charts to visualize scenario impacts.
- Exportable results and lightweight data persistence using `sessionStorage` for quick workflows.

## How to run locally

Requirements: Node.js and npm (or pnpm).

```bash
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the site at http://localhost:8080/ (default port configured in `vite.config.ts`).

## Project structure

- `src/` — application source (pages, components, hooks, lib)
- `public/` — static assets (favicon, logo)
- `package.json` — dependencies & scripts

## Running the simulator

- Start dev server: `npm run dev` (defaults to http://localhost:8080)
- Configure parameters on the `Simulate` page and click **Run Simulation**.
- Results are stored in `sessionStorage` and shown on the `Results` page.

## Logo / branding

Place your `logo.png` in `public/logo.png`. The header will use `/logo.png` if present. If you want me to add the supplied image, reply “Add logo” and I will convert and commit it as `public/logo.png` and adjust header styling.

## Testing & linting

- Lint: `npm run lint`

## Notes on sanitization

This repo was scaffolded with an automated starter. I removed obvious generator traces from the UI and metadata, but if you want commit messages scrubbed from history I can prepare a safe `git filter-repo` workflow — note this rewrites history and requires coordination with collaborators.

## License & credits

Add a `LICENSE` file if you want to publish under a chosen license. This project is intended for academic and policy analysis.

If you'd like me to add your supplied image as `public/logo.png` now, reply “Add logo” and I'll convert and commit it.
